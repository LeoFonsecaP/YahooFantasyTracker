The Yahoo fantasy tracker is a tool to make our fantasy league cooler, with a website that stores all data. In the future a twitter bot and a computer script might get added.
The goal is to make it as professional as possible.

None of this wouldÂ´ve been possible without the base code provided by https://github.com/bbenbenek/nfl-fantasy-football, that helped make the connection to the fantasy API. The functions on his code have been altered by me. I also added a parser, to organize the large data that comes via the API. However, the connection system remains the same and the original documentation is not helpful, so his code makes this possible. The license is stored along with the project.
